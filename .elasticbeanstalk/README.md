# .elasticbeanstalk Configuration Folder

## Files in this folder:

### ✅ config.yml.example
- Template showing what `config.yml` should contain
- **DO NOT COMMIT** - it's auto-generated and environment-specific
- Generated by running: `eb init`

## Why config.yml is NOT committed:

❌ **Auto-generated** - Created by `eb init` command  
❌ **Environment-specific** - Contains local settings  
❌ **Not needed** - Each developer/environment has their own  
❌ **In .gitignore** - Automatically excluded from git  

## Next Steps:

### When deploying for the first time:

```bash
# Initialize Elastic Beanstalk (this creates config.yml)
eb init -p "PHP 7.4 running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2" \
        --region us-east-1 \
        library-app

# Create environment
eb create library-app-env --instance-type t3.micro

# Deploy
eb deploy
```

### config.yml will be created automatically with your local settings

You can safely commit everything in this folder EXCEPT `config.yml`
